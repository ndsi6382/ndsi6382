I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney. My current research focuses on privacy in graphs. More broadly, my research interests involve applications of algorithms, heuristics, and machine learning techniques to enhance privacy, security, and fairness.
