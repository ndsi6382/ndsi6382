I am a computer science student at the University of New South Wales, where I 
specialise in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science & Engineering as part of the 
Master of Information Technology program. 

My research interests center around applications of algorithms, heuristics, and machine learning techniques for enhancing privacy, security, fairness, and safety.
