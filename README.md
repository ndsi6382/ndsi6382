I am a computer science student at the University of New South Wales, where I 
specialise in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science & Engineering as part of the 
Master of Information Technology program. 

I have interests in intractable problems, discrete optimization, and computational social choice. 
I also enjoy being a staff member for UNSW's Algorithm Design and Analysis course.
